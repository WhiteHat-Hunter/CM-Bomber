~ CM-Bomber Tool Coded By Mr.Siddhesh ~

> CM-Bomber v 7.0 <


*A free and open-source Call-Message bombing Tool Using Python*

NOTE:
Due to the overuse of script, a bunch of APIs have been taken offline. It is okay if you do not receive all the messages.


- The application requires active internet connection to contact the APIs
- You would not be charged for any SMS/calls dispatched as a consequence of this script
- For best performance, use single thread with considerable delay time
- Always ensure that you are using the latest version of CM-Bomber and have Python 3
- This application must not be used to cause harm/discomfort/trouble to others

Compatibility:
Check your Python version by typing in

shell script:

If you get the following shell script:
Python 3.8.3 or any version greater than or equal to 3.4, this script has been tested and confirmed to be supported. For obsolete versions of Python (eg 2.7),
use discretion while executing the script as it has not been tested there.

Features:
